## Frontend Ride Coding Task Sixt - Mehmet NAMIDURU

---

### How to run project

- It's basic create-react-app project
- Please run the followings to start up
```
npm install
npm run start
```

### Project dependencies

- It's create-react-app project so it has some dependencies that comes by default.
- I added axios dependency for making request in encapsulated way
- Added material-ui to use pre-defined styled components and added my own stylings on some parts.
- Added lodash just for debounce method.
- Added moment for parsing dates in proper format.

### Notes

- I didn't use Redux for state management because project is so small to deal with these kind of technologies.
- I'm writing CSS's per components (Component Styling) not global css.
- I assumed the duration time would only be 2, 3 or 4.
